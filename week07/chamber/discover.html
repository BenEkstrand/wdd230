                    <p class="fact">Skorne warbands descended on Malburg from the surrounding hills and forests to plunder the now defenseless city. The scant few who managed to flee the city alive were left physically twisted and scarred, and mentally shattered. They do not take prisoners and have been known to eat the fallen. Avoid at all costs.

                    <p class="fact">At least one giant has been seen and heard crashing its way throughout the ruins of Malburg as it seeks its fill of adventurers and creatures alike. This beast is a twisted abomination of its mountainous cousin, corrupted by the Warpstone's power, enraging, twisting and empowering it. If you hear its bone-chilling roar, it is probably too late for you.</p>

Hold yourself up at night and pray they do not find you.</p>
